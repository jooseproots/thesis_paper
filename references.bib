	abstract = {Quitting Basic Military Training ({BMT}) is a problem in the Dutch Armed Forces. Previous research focused on physical factors. Yet, contemporary research focuses on psychosocial characteristics, study skills, and quality of life factors associated with recruits’ intention to quit {BMT}. We combined several factors to identify the key factors affecting recruits’ intentions to quit {BMT}. We also studied gender and rank position differences. Three hundred fifty-five recruits enrolled in {BMT} participated by completing a self-report questionnaire. Multiple regression analysis showed that being highly engaged with {BMT}, having a high sense of belonging, and being highly proactive resulted in lower intention to quit. Having a high sense of responsibility resulted in higher intention to quit {BMT}. For gender, significant differences were found in study skills and self-esteem. For rank positions, significant differences were found in several psychosocial characteristics, study skills, quality of life factors, and intention to quit; with officer rank recruits showing higher intentions to quit than noncommissioned officer rank recruits. These identified factors can be used to improve conditions for {BMT} recruits. It is further advised to investigate the origin of gender and rank position differences that affect associations between psychosocial characteristics, study skills, quality of life factors, and recruits’ intention to quit, so that these differences can be minimized in the future.},

Comparisons are made among General Educational Development ({GED}) holders, high school graduates, and non-high school graduates entering the military on background variables such as age. Performance in the military is also examined. Data from Job Corps trainee data files were used in conjunction with military enlistment data files to prepare descriptions of male Job Corps entrants to the military, and to compare those entrants to non-entrants and to enlistees in general. The performance of Job Corps entrants to the military is also described, and comparisons made with male enlistee performance in general},

	abstract = {This monograph provides an empirical analysis of the enlistment, attrition, and reenlistment effects of bonuses, applying statistical models that control for such other factors as recruiting resources, in the case of enlistment and deployments in the case of reenlistment, and demographics. Enlistment and attrition models are estimated for the Army and our reenlistment model approach is twofold. The Army has greatly increased its use of reenlistment bonuses since {FY} 2004, and we begin by providing an in-depth history of the many changes in its reenlistment bonus program during this decade. We follow this with two independent analyses of the effect of bonuses on Army reenlistment. As we show, the results from the models are consistent, lending credence to the robustness of the estimates. One approach is extended to the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Air Force, to obtain estimates of the effect of bonuses on reenlistment for all services. We also estimate an enlistment model for the Navy. The estimated models are used to address questions about the cost-effectiveness of bonuses and their effects in offsetting other factors that might adversely affect recruiting and retention, such as changes in the civilian economy and frequent deployments},

All of these areas are important in the overall scheme of model development, and they cannot be separated from what is to follow. In this chapter we concern ourselves with issues related to the whole model, with emphasis on deciding on the amount of complexity to allow in the model and on dealing with large numbers of predictors. The chapter concludes with three default modeling strategies depending on whether the goal is prediction, estimation, or hypothesis testing.",

	abstract = {The Variance Inflation Factor ({VIF}) and tolerance are both widely used measures of the degree of multi-collinearity of the ith independent variable with the other independent variables in a regression model. Unfortunately, several rules of thumb – most commonly the rule of 10 – associated with {VIF} are regarded by many practitioners as a sign of severe or serious multi-collinearity (this rule appears in both scholarly articles and advanced statistical textbooks). When {VIF} reaches these threshold values researchers often attempt to reduce the collinearity by eliminating one or more variables from their analysis; using Ridge Regression to analyze their data; or combining two or more independent variables into a single index. These techniques for curing problems associated with multi-collinearity can create problems more serious than those they solve. Because of this, we examine these rules of thumb and find that threshold values of the {VIF} (and tolerance) need to be evaluated in the context of several other factors that influence the variance of regression coefficients. Values of the {VIF} of 10, 20, 40, or even higher do not, by themselves, discount the results of regression analyses, call for the elimination of one or more independent variables from the analysis, suggest the use of ridge regression, or require combining of independent variable into a single index.},
